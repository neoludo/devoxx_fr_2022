# Hands on Lab "DÃ©ployer Vault et Consul dans Kubernetes"

These are the instructions to follow the Hands on Lab at Devoxx Paris 2022.

See `https://cfp.devoxx.fr/2022/talk/FWL-5289/Deployer_Vault_et_Consul_dans_Kubernetes`

`0 - Lab materials` contains the prerequisites.

There 6 labs. For each lab there is a directory `labX` and an associated `labX-solution` (except for `lab6`), which contains the missing bits.

These instructions are used by participants, in conjunction with a slideshow giving the overall context for each lab.

As a participant, it is recommended to fork this repo, and replace all `<userId>` tags with the user id that will be provided to each participant during the session.
